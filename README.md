These are the sources I used to help write my code: [https://developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference), google, and BCS â€” watching our cloud recordings, using instructor activity solutions and the class activities as references.

In this assignment, the task is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

Here are the steps I did to achieve this:

### Building Metadata Panel

1. Retrieve metadata from the JSON file.
2. Filter the metadata for the desired sample.
3. Select the HTML panel where the metadata will be displayed.
4. Clear any existing metadata in the panel.
5. Append new HTML tags for each key-value pair in the filtered metadata, displaying them in uppercase format.
